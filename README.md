# Bellabeat Case Study

This is a Capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In this project, we analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data to help Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices.

## 🔎 Project Objective

Analyze smart device usage data to discover trends in user activity, sleep, and calorie burn that can guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## 📂 Dataset

The data used in this project was publicly available from Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data
dailyActivity_merged.csv: Steps, distance, calories, etc.
sleepDay_merged.csv: Sleep data
hourlySteps_merged.csv: Hourly step counts
hourlyCalories_merged.csv: Hourly calories burned
hourlyIntensities_merged.csv: Hourly intensity levels

## 📅 Timeline
Ask: Define business questions
Prepare: Load, combine, and inspect raw data
Process: Clean data (remove duplicates, outliers, handle missing values)
Analyze: Perform statistical analysis and group-based aggregations
Share: Visualize findings with charts and graphs
Act: Make actionable recommendations

## ⚙️ Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Git & GitHub for version control

## 📊 Key Analysis Questions
Are users consistent with the number of steps throughout the week?
What is the correlation between sleep time and time in bed?
What time of day are users most active?
Who are the active, average, and inactive users?
How does calorie burn vary across weekdays?

## 📈 Visualizations
Average Steps by Day of Week
Total Minutes Asleep vs Total Time in Bed
Hourly Activity Line Plot
Pie chart of user categories (Active, Average, Inactive)
Awake Time in Bed by Day
Screenshots and plots are saved in the images/ folder.

## 📉 Key Insights
Activity levels are generally higher on weekdays
Most users are moderately active, with only a few highly active users
Users tend to sleep more on weekends
Strong correlation between time in bed and actual sleep

## 📆 Recommendations
Target less active users with motivational nudges
Promote better sleep habits via reminders
Focus on weekday fitness programs
